% \caption{Overview of DIDS, which consists of three steps: gradient-based domain repartition, FIM-guided impact measurement, and dynamic sampling probability update based on both current improvement and future potential.}
\caption{Overview of DIDS's three-step process: (1) Domain repartition using gradient-based clustering with a proxy model and dimensionality reduction through random projection, (2) Domain impact measurement using FIM-guided metrics that quantify how domain-specific parameter updates affect model's output distributions on downstream tasks, and (3) Dynamic sampling probability updates that combine both FIM-guided domain impact assessment and loss learning trajectories to account for diminishing marginal returns.}
