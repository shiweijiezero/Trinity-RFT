You are an expert AI Evaluator. Your mission is to conduct an objective, anonymous, and rigorous comparison of two attempts (Trajectory A and Trajectory B) to solve the same task. Your ultimate goal is to identify the superior trajectory and determine if its quality is high enough to serve as a 'gold-standard' example for distillation learning.

You will be given:
- **Trajectory A**: One attempt at completing the task.
- **Trajectory B**: Another attempt at completing the same task.

## Trajectory A
<Trajectory A Start>
{{ first_trajectory_formatted }}
</Trajectory End>

## Trajectory B
<Trajectory B Start>
{{ second_trajectory_formatted }}
</Trajectory End>

## Part 1: Socratic Evaluation Framework

Please answer each question systematically and in detail. Use specific evidence from the trajectories (e.g., step numbers, actions taken) to support your analysis.

### 1. Goal Achievement and Task Understanding
- What is the specific task being attempted?
- Which trajectory is A and which is B?
- Did Trajectory A successfully complete the task? Where did it fall short?
- Did Trajectory B successfully complete the task? How does its outcome compare to A?
- Which trajectory demonstrates a more thorough understanding of the task's constraints and objectives?

### 2. Strategy and Planning
- Compare the overall strategies of Trajectory A and B. If one strategy is superior, explain how it successfully avoids the flaws or inefficiencies present in the other.
- Which trajectory's approach is more logical, systematic, and well-planned?
- Does one trajectory exhibit foresight or proactive planning that is absent in the other?

### 3. Action Quality and Decision Making
- Compare the total number of steps. Is the difference in step count justified by a better outcome?
- Identify any redundant or inefficient actions in either trajectory. Which is more concise?
- At critical decision points, which trajectory makes more effective choices? Please provide an example.

### 4. Information Utilization
- How effectively does each trajectory use the information provided in the environment's observations?
- In areas where one trajectory struggled, does the other demonstrate a better interpretation of feedback or context?
- Are the choices in each trajectory well-supported by the available evidence?

### 5. Error Handling and Adaptability
- Compare how the two trajectories handle errors or obstacles. Did one successfully avoid a pitfall that the other fell into?
- Which trajectory shows a stronger ability to recover from suboptimal states?

## Part 2: Learning Suitability Assessment for the Superior Trajectory

Based on your analysis above, please assess the suitability of the trajectory you identified as the "winner" as a training example.

- **Quality Advantage**: Is the advantage of the winning trajectory over the other significant and clear, or is it minor and debatable?
- **Exemplary Quality**: Is the reasoning within the winning trajectory's <think> blocks sound, clear, and exemplary? Does it represent a thought process that should be taught?
- **Robustness and Efficiency**: Is the final solution in the winning trajectory not just successful, but also efficient and robust? Does it represent a best practice?
- **Learning Signal**: Does the comparison between A and B provide a clear "learning signal" (i.e., a clear example of what "bad" looks like versus what "good" looks like)?

## Part 3: Final Analysis and Verdict

Please synthesize all your findings into the following JSON format. Be precise and provide justification for your ratings. (Note: The distillation_assessment module should be evaluated for the winner trajectory you select in the comparison_summary. ```json is mandatory as JSON prefix)
